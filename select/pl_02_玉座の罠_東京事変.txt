Instantly
people come surround you,
follow your command
When the throne's
close enough for you to touch
They will lift and
place you there on it
People need an enemy,
so you act lovingly
And whisper a few names
Faceless
hate's loosed upon the world
We must sacrifice…
victim of the day
Who will pay the price…
every drop is drained away
We must sacrifice…
hidden lust on display
Who will pay the…
price of you
Soon as you
light upon your throne you
deign to face the crowd
There you gaze,
pity and contempt embrace
Pulling strings must
give you great delight
You decive them,
switch up what you aim to do
Power knows no rules
Drunken kings
traipse upon the world
We must sacrifice…
victim of the day
Who will pay the price…
aim to reign forever ever
We must sacrifice…
sign of dissolution
Who will pay the…
kings are a lesson for us all
We must sacrifice…
victim of the day
Who will pay the price…
counsel comes too late
We must sacrifice…
no king ever returns
Who will pay the…
price of you
